/**
 * When a Panner object is added to a CoordinateRect, it becomes possible to 
 * "grab" the coordinate rectangle and pan it (that is, slide it around by 
 * moving it with the mouse).  By default, the user must right-click-and-drag
 * to pan the coordinates, but this can be changed by providing an argument to
 * the constructor.  It is possible to set a Controller to be notified each time
 * the mouse moves while the user is dragging.  Alternatively, or in addition,
 * you can set a Controller to be notified when the user finishes dragging.
 * However, for the most part this is unnecessary, since the Drawables in the
 * CoordinateRect will for the most part redraw themselves properly when the
 * limits on the CoordinateRect change.  However, if you have Computable objects 
 * that depend on the coordinate limits, then they will need to be recomputed.
 * (This will be the case if you use value objects returned by the
 * getValueObject() method in the CoordinateRect class.)
 * <p>A Panner, p, is inactive if its "visible" property has been set to false.
 * (This is done by calling p.setVisible(false).)
