/**
 * Controllers are the focus of all the action in the JCM system.  A Controller can be
 * set to listen for changes (generally changes in user input).  This is done by
 * registering the Controller with (usally) an InputObject.  For example, if a Controller, c,
 * is to respond when the user presses return in a VariableInput, v, then
 * v.setOnUserAction(c) should be called to arrange to have the Controller listen
 * for such actions.   VariableSliders, ExpressionInputs, MouseTrackers, Animators have a similar
 * methods.  It is also possible to set the Controller to listen for events of
 * type AdjustmentEvent, ActionEvent, TextEvent, or ItemEvent (but this feature is
 * left over from an older version of JCM, and I'm not sure whether it's necessary).
 * Whenever a Controller learns of some change, it will process any InputObjects,
 * Ties, and Computables that have been registered with it.
 *   
 * <p>InputObjects and Computables have to be added to a Controller to be processed,
 * using the Controller's add method.  (If you build your inteface out of JCMPanels,
 * then this is done automatically.)  (Note that an InputObject is added to a Controller
 * to have its value checked -- This is separate from registering the Controller to
 * listen for changes in the InputObject.  Often, you have to do both.)  The gatherInputs()
 * method in class JCMPanel can be used to do most of this registration automaticaly.
 *   
 * <p>A Tie that synchronizes two or more Values, to be effective, has to be added to a Controller.
 * See the Tie class for inforamtion about what Ties are and how they are used.
 *   
 * <p>A Controller can have an associated ErrorReporter, which is used to report any
 * errors that occur during the processing.  Currently, an ErrorReporter is either
 * a DisplayCanvas or a MessagePopup.
 *   
 * <p>A Controller can be added to another Controller, which then becomes a sub-controller.
 * Whenever the main Controller hears some action, it also notifies all its sub-controllers
 * about the action.  Furthermore, it can report errors that occur in the sub-controllers,
 * if they don't have their own error reporters.  (Usually, you will just set an error 
 * reporter for the top-level Controller.)
