/**
 * An InputObject represents some sort of value that can be changed
 * by, for example, user interaction with a GUI element.  The value can
 * actually change only when the checkInput() method is called.  Generally,
 * an InputObject is a GUI element with an associated MathObject such as
 * a Variable or Expression.  For example, a VariableInput is a text-input
 * box where the user can enter the value of a Variable.  However, the
 * input is only checked and the value of the variable can only change
 * when the VariableInput's checkInput() method is called.  The checkInput()
 * method is generally meant to be called by a Controller object.  The
 * checkInput() method should throw a JCMError if an error occurs.
 * See the Controller class for more information.
