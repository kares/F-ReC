/**
 * A WrapperFunction contains another function and delegates to it
 * all calls to methods from the Function interface, except for calls
 * to setName() and getName().  (It maintains its own name, which can
 * be different from the name of the wrapped Function.)  This has at least two 
 * uses:  A WrapperFunction is a FunctionParserExtension, so it can
 * be added to a parser and then used in expressions parsed in that
 * parser.  Second, the function that is wrapped inside the WrapperFunction
 * object can be changed by a call to the setFunction() method.
 * This makes it possible to have a single function that can be used,
 * for example, in ValueMath objects and Graph1D's, whose definition
 * can be changed at will.  Note that it is NOT legal to change the
 * arity of the function when calling the setFunction() method.
