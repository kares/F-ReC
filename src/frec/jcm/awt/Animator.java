/**
 * An Animator can change a value continuously, without user intervention, by running
 * a separate Thread.  By default, an animator appears as a "Start" button.  When the
 * button is pressed, the value of the animator starts counting 0, 1, 2, ...  The button
 * changes to a "Stop" button.  When this is pressed, the value stops changing.  A Controller
 * can be set, by calling the setOnChange() method, to be notified whenever the value is
 * changed.  If this is done, then the value of the Animator will only change when its
 * checkInput() method is called, so it should be added to a Controller which will call
 * this method.
 *
 * <p>The getValueAsVariable() method can be called to get a Variable whose value is
 * the value of the Animator.  This variable can then be added to a Parser, so it can
 * be used in expressions.  An Animator is "Tieable", so it can share its value
 * with another InputObject, such as a VariableSlider or a VariableIput.
 *
 * <p>There are many options:  If maximum and minimum values are both specified, then the value
 * of the Animator ranges between these values.  By default, this interval is divided into
 * 100 sub-intervals, so that there are 101 frames.  However, the number of intervals can
 * also be set.  If no min or max is specified but a number of intervals is specified,
 * then the value is an integer which ranges from 0 up to the specified number of intervals.
 * If the number of frames is finite, then there are three possibities when the last
 * frame is reached:  The animation can stop; it can loop back to the the starting
 * frame, or it can reverse direction and cycle back and forth.  The behavior is controlled
 * with the setLoopStyle() method.
 *
 * <p>An Animator is actually a Panel which can contain other controls in addition to or
 * instead of the Start/Stop button.  For example, it can contain a "Next" button or
 * a pop-up menu to control the speed.
 *
