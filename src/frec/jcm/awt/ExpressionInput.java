/**
 * This class is from edu.hws.jcm.awt package without any modification.
 * An ExpressionInput is an input box that allows the user
 * input a mathematical expression.  There is an associated
 * object that belongs to the class Expression.  The
 * value of this object can change only when checkInput()
 * is called.  The checkInput() method is usually called by a Controller.
 *    <p>An ExpressionInput will ordinarily be registered with
 * a Controller in TWO ways:  It's added to a Controller
 * with the Controller's add() method.  This makes the Contrller
 * call the ExpressionInput's checkInput() method during the
 * Controller's compute() method.  Secondly, the Controller
 * is set as the "onUserAction" property.  This causes the
 * Controller's compute() method to be called when the user
 * presses return in the ExpressionInput box.  This is optional--
 * you might, for example, only want the Controller to compute()
 * when a Compute button is pressed.  You can also set the
 * ExpressionInput's onTextChange property to a Controller
 * if you want it to compute every time the text in the box
 * changes.
 *    <p>Use the function getFunction() if you want to
 * use an ExpressionInput as a way of inputting a function.
