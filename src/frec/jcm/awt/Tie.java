/**
 * A Tie associates several Tieable objects.  When the check() mehtod of the
 * Tie is called, it determines which of the Tieables has the largest serial number.
 * It then tells each Tieable to synchronize with that object.  Ordinarily, the
 * Tie is added to a Controller, which is responsible for calling the Tie's
 * check() method.
 *  
 * <p>This is meant to be used, for example, to Tie together two InputObjects to synchronize
 * the values that they represent.  For example, you might want a VariableSlider
 * and a VariableInput to be alternative ways of inputting the same value.  If so,
 * you can put them in a Tie and add that Tie to any Controller that is set to
 * respond to changes in the VariableSlider or VariableInput.
 * The x- and y- variables of a MouseTracker are also Tieable objects, so you
 * can synchronize the values of two MouseTrackers (in different CoordinateRects,
 * presumably) and you can synchronize the value of a MouseTracker variable with
 * a VariableInput or VariableSlider.
 *  
 * <p>CoordinateRects and LimitControlPanels are also Tieable (to each other -- not
 * to Value objects).  This is used to allow the LimitControlPanel to synchronize
 * with the Limits on the CoordinateRects that it controls.  It could also 
 * synchronize the Limits on two CoordinateRects, even in the absense of a
 * LimitControlPanel.
