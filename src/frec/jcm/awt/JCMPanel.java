/**
 * This class is from edu.hws.jcm.awt package without any modification.
 * A JCMPanel is a Panel with an associated Controller.  When an InputObject or
 * Computable is added to the JCMPanel, it is automatically added to the controller.
 * When a sub-JCMPanel is added, the Controller of the sub-panel is "attatched" to
 * the controller of the main panel so that objects in the sub-panel will also
 * be controlled by the Controller of the main panel.  So, if you build an
 * interface entirely from JCMPanels, a lot of the control setup is done
 * automatically.  Note that to make this work, you will need
 * a "mainPanel" that fills the entire window or applet (or at least the part that
 * holds JCM components).  You should also call the gatherInputs() method of
 * the main JCMPanel after it is completely set up, so that changes in input objects
 * will cause the panel's controller to be notified, or, alternatively, you
 * can register the Controller by hand with InputObjects so that the
 * Controller will be notified when they change.
 * 
 * <p>The disadvantage of this is that all the data used in the interface is recomputed,
 * even if the input objects that they depend on have not changed.  For example.
 * if the user changes the value in a VarialbleInput, all the points on a graph
 * will be recomputed even if the function has not changed.  The alternative is
 * to use regular Panels for all or part of the interface and configure some
 * Controllers by hand.
