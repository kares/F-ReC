/**
 * A DrawGeometric object is a geometic figure such as a line or rectangle that can
 * be drawn in a CoordinateRect.  The data for the object always consists of four
 * numbers, which are interpreted differenetly depending on the object.  These numbers
 * can be specified as Value objects.  A DrawGeometric is a Computable, and the 
 * Values will be re-computed when its compute() method is called.  It should be
 * added to a Controller that can respond to any changes in the data that define
 * the Values.  If one of the Value objects has an undefined value, nothing will be drawn.
 * <p>The type of object is given as one of the constants defined in this class:
 * LINE_ABSOLUTE, OVAL_RELATIVE, CROSS, and so on.  In the descriptions of these
 * constants, x1, x2, y1, and y2 refer to the values of Value objects that provide data
 * for the DrawGeomentric while h and v refer to int's that can be specified in place of
 * x2 and y2 for certain types of figures.  For those figures, h or v is used if
 * x2 or y2, respectively, is null.
