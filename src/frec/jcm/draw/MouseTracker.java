/** 
 * This class is from edu.hws.jcm.draw package without any modification.
 * A MouseTracker can be added to a CoordinateRect in a DisplayCanvas to respond to user
 * mouse actions in the rectangular area occupied by the CoordinateRect.  Two
 * Variable objects, which can be retrieved by calling getXVar() and getYVar(),
 * represent the location of the most recent mouse action in terms of the coordinates
 * of the CoordinateRect.  Note that these variables are Tieable objects, so they
 * can be synchronized with other means of inputting the same information.
 * The default names of the variables, if you don't change them, are "xMouse"
 * and "yMouse".
 * 
 * <p>A MouseTracker is an InputObject. The values of the variables associated with the
 * MouseTracker can change only when the checkInput() method is called (or when
 * the setVal() method of the variable is called to set its value explicitely).
 * If you want the value of the variables to track the mouse, you must 
 * add the MouseTracker (or the DisplayCanvas that contains it) to a Controller 
 * and set that Controller to listen for changes from the MouseTracker object by 
 * passing the Controller to the setOnUserAction() method of this class.
